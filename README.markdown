# Networking Practice Labs

This repository contains my Cisco Packet Tracer labs for learning networking concepts like subnetting, VLANs, and routing. These are practice files created as part of my studies.

## How to Use
1. Install [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) (free with a Cisco Networking Academy account).
2. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kolhe-Parth/Computer_Networking_Practicals.git
   ```
3. Open `.pkt` files in Packet Tracer to practice the labs.

## Notes
- Labs are for educational purposes only.
- Files are organized by topic (e.g., VLANs, routing).
- Contact me via GitHub issues for questions.
